# Dragon Ball Z Fighter Database

## Introduction
The Dragon Ball Z Fighter Database is a web application designed to catalog characters from the "Dragon Ball" universe, ranging from classic Dragon Ball to Dragon Ball Super. Users can view detailed information about each fighter, including their power levels, races, and strongest techniques. The database includes a dynamic search feature, powered by Fuse.js, that allows users to quickly find fighters based on names or abilities.

## Features
- **Fighter Listings:** Browse a list of fighters from the Dragon Ball universe with details like name, power level, race, universe, and strongest technique.
- **Search Functionality:** Utilizes Fuse.js for fuzzy searching through the fighter list, allowing partial and mismatched queries to return accurate results.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive web pages that ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Authentication:** Supports user registration and login functionality for personalized experiences.
- **Image Storage:** Fighter images are stored and managed efficiently, ensuring quick load times and high availability.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** For backend server functionality.
- **Express.js:** Framework used to build the web application.
- **MongoDB:** Database to store fighter details.
- **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Handlebars:** Templating engine used to render HTML templates.
- **Bootstrap:** For styling and responsive design.
- **Fuse.js:** For implementing search functionality.
